Alhumdulillah! Done Task #1  given by CodeAlpha !!🎉👩‍💻

I recently completed a task that has been a great learning experience and a testament to my growth during this internship.  🤖 💎 
My project is an age calculator. This tool, which takes a user's birthdate and calculates their age, is an excellent way to demonstrate my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 🚀 🤖 👀
